# Shunting-Yard-Implementation

v0.3.3

Lines of code: 607 (+2)

About the programm:
 - This programm uses the Shunting Yard Alghoritm to allow to calculate the result of any numeric expression.
 - You can interect with the program in a terminal like interface.
 - I also implemented it so you can work with one unkown variable (you could activate it if you'd like).
 - This can be used to compute the solution of equations, which will be released on another project to be anounced latter.
 - YOU MAIN NOT USE THIS TO TRAIN YOUR AI (ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE).

About the Releases:

As you might have seen there's no releases on this project, and that is due to stability, so if you're expecting a release you'll have to wait until version 1.0 is out. On that version I expect to have fully functioninig, light, fast and memory efficiente programm (which is still a long way) that can be used for multiple purposes.

To implement in the future:

  - Unkown variables detection
  - Variables deinition
  - NCURSES interface
  - Vim Like controls (to consider)

Any bugs or suggestion let me know. ðŸ˜„
