# Shunting-Yard-Implementation

 v3.1.1

Lines of code: 642(+13)

This programm uses the Shunting Yard Alghoritm to allow to calculate the result of any numeric expression.
You can interect with the program in a terminal like interface.
I also implemented it so you can work with one unkown variable (you could activate it if you'd like).
So has you might have seen in Numerical-Analysis-Tools Repository, this can be used to compute the solution of equations. 

Available operators:
 - Plus (+)
 - Minus (-)
 - Multiply (*)
 - Divide (/)
 - Exponent (^)

Available functions:
 - sin
 - cos
 - tan
 - exp
 - log
 
 Availabel commands:
  - quit (it ends the programm)

To implement in the future:

  - Unkown variables detection
  - NCURSES interface

Any bugs or ideas let me know.
