# Shunting-Yard-Implementation

v0.3.2

Lines of code: 647 (-7)

About the programm:
 - This programm uses the Shunting Yard Alghoritm to allow to calculate the result of any numeric expression.
 - You can interect with the program in a terminal like interface.
 - I also implemented it so you can work with one unkown variable (you could activate it if you'd like).
 - This can be used to compute the solution of equations, which will be released on another project to be anounced latter.

------------------------------------------

Available operators:
 - Plus (+)
 - Minus (-)
 - Multiply (*)
 - Divide (/)
 - Exponent (^)

Available functions:
 - sin
 - cos
 - tan
 - exp
 - log
 
 Availabel commands:
  - quit (it ends the programm)
  - clear (wipes the screen)

-------------------------------------

About the Releases: 

As you might have seen there's no releases on this project, and that is due to stability, so if you're expecting a release you'll have to wait until version 1.0 is out. On that version I expect to have fully functioninig, light, fast and memory efficiente programm (which is still a long way) that can be used for multiple purposes.

To implement in the future:

  - Unkown variables detection
  - Variables deinition
  - NCURSES interface
  - Vim Like controls (to consider)

Any bugs or suggestion let me know. ðŸ˜„
