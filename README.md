# Shunting-Yard-Implementation

V 3.0

Lines of code: 597(-90)

This programm uses the Shunting Yard Alghoritm to allow to calculate the result of any numeric expression.
I also implemented it so you can work with one unkown variable (you could implement more if you'd like).
So has you might have seen in Numerical-Analysis-Tools Repository, this can be used to compute the solution of equations. 

To implement in the future:

  .Bad use of function detection
  .Unkown variables detection

Any bugs or ideas let me know.
